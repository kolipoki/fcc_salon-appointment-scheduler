# fcc_salon-appointment-scheduler

Mini project for the FreeCodeCamp Relational Databases (Beta) Certification.

For this project, I created an interactive Bash program that uses PostgreSQL to track the customers and appointments for a salon.

It updates the database with new appoitments as well as new customers when these are detected.
